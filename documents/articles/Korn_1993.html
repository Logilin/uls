by David G. Korn, Charles J. Northrup, and Jeffery Korn
</I>
<P>
The Unix system was one of the first systems that didn't
make the command interpreter a part of the operating system or
a privileged task. It was written as an ordinary user process
with no special permissions or calls to unadvertised functions.
This has led to a succession of better and better shells. The
early generations of Unix came with a command shell written by
Ken Thompson, one of the inventors of the Unix system. By the
late 1970s, two vastly improved shells emerged. The Bourne
shell, created by Steve Bourne at Bell Telephone Laboratories,
was a big improvement as a language. The C shell, created by
Bill Joy at the University of California at Berkeley, was a
much improved command interpreter but a poor language.
<P>
The Korn Shell, written by David Korn at Bell Telephone
Laboratories, combined the best features of both of these
shells, and added the ability to edit and reenter the current
and previous commands using the same keystrokes as either the
vi or the Emacs editor as the user desired. This shell became
very popular, but its distribution was restricted. As a result,
several freely available imitations such as pdksh and bash were
created. An enhanced version of C shell, tcsh, was created to
provide visual editing to C shell users.
<P>
While the Bourne shell provided a good basis for programming,
and this was improved upon by earlier versions of Korn Shell, it
was not adequate for general purpose scripting without
combining it with other languages such as the awk programming
language. While in most instances the two languages work well
together, the performance penalty of using two languages with
separate processes is often prohibitive. The Perl language was
created to provide a single language with the combined
functionality of the shell and awk. However, Perl has a syntax
that many find difficult to understand.
<P>
ksh93, the latest major revision of the Korn Shell language
provides an alternative to Tcl and Perl. As a programming
language, it has comparable speed and functionality to each of
these languages, yet is arguably the best interactive shell. It
is a superset of the POSIX 1003.2 shell standard. Like Tcl, it
is extensible and embeddable with a C language application
programming interface. In fact, two graphical shells have been
created using ksh93. One of these, dTksh, is a Motif-based
language developed by Novell. The other, Tksh, written by Jeff
Korn at Princeton University, uses the Tk library, and is
briefly discussed here.
<P>
The best way to describe the new features found in ksh93 is to
illustrate them through an example. We will create a shell
script named <B>lsc</B>, shown in <a href="kornlist.html">Listing
1</a>, to provide an
<B>ls</B> output with subdirectory names printed in bold. We
will need to maintain the multi-column output associated with
the standard ls.
<P>
The lsc script will produce the ls output for each
directory name provided as a command line argument. The default
action is to produce the ls output for the current directory.
Several modifications can be made to the lsc script for
enhanced performance. We leave them as an exercise for the
reader. We perform the following high level actions for each
directory name to be processed.
<P>
for each directory,  do:
<P>
<TT>  </TT>load directory entries into array entries
<TT>     </TT>load entries
<TT>     </TT>calculate number of columns in multi-column output
<TT>     </TT>calculate maximum number of rows
<TT>  </TT>print the current directory name
<TT>  </TT>determine output layout
<TT>     </TT>add entries to <TT>row[]</TT> array
<TT>     </TT>add entries to <TT>col[]</TT> array
<TT>     </TT>calculate the column widths
<TT>  </TT>display the output
done
<P>
<h2>Arrays</h2>
<P>
ksh93 provides one-dimensional indexed and associative
arrays. An array element is referenced as
<TT><I>varName</I>[<I>subscript</I>]</TT>. Indexed arrays use
arithmetic expressions for subscripts. This permits computation
within the subscript expression. The statement
<TT>varName[3+8]</TT> for example, references the 11th element
of the indexed array. (Arithmetic expressions are described
more fully below).
<P>
The elements of an indexed array can be initialized from a list
using the <TT><I>varName</I>=(....)</TT> command. This provides
a convenient notation for initializing an array to contain the
names of files in a given directory. The number of entries in
the array describes the number of files found. As an example,
consider the following statement to initialize the entries
indexed array with the names of files found in the current
directory: <TT>entries=(*)</TT>
<P>
An associative array uses arbitrary strings for subscripts. We
could, for example, create a state tax associative array and
reference elements by the state name. This works even for space
separated tokens within the string, such as New Jersey.
<P>
<PRE>
typeset -A StateTax
StateTax[New Jersey]=0.06
print ${StateTax[New Jersey]}
</PRE>
<P>
Several special positional parameter expansions are provided
for array processing. Using <TT>${<I>varName</I>[@]}</TT> refers
to all elements of the array. The subscripts of an array can be
referenced with <TT>${!<I>varName</I>[@]}</TT>. The notation
<TT>${#<I>varName</I>[@]}</TT> provides the number of elements
within the array. Elements within a numeric subscript range can
be referenced using
<TT>${<I>varName</I>[@]:<I>offset</I>:<I>length</I>}</TT>. This
special notation works with both indexed and associative
arrays.
<P>
Arrays are used throughout the example lsc script. We define
<TT>video</TT> as an associative array with capability names from
the <I>terminfo</I> database as subscripts. The definition of
<TT>video</TT> is provided as a compound assignment for an associative array.
<P>
<PRE>
video=(
   [bold]=$(tput bold)
   [reset]=$(tput reset)
   [reverse]=$(tput reverse)
)
</PRE>
<P>
Each element is assigned a value from the standard output of
a <B>tput</B> execution for the capability name. For example,
<TT>video[bold]</TT> is the terminfo sequence for bold
lettering. Similarly, <TT>video[reverse]</TT> will provide
reverse video output.
<P>
Using the notation <TT>$(<I>command</I>)</TT> will cause
<TT><I>command</I></TT> to execute in a subshell of the current
ksh. In many instances, ksh will not actually fork/exec a
subshell when command is a built-in or a shell function.
(Built-in functions are described below).
<P>
<h2>Expanded Name Space</h2>
<P>
In ksh93 a variable is defined by a
<TT><I>name</I>=<I>value</I></TT> pair. The variable name space
is hierarchical with <TT><B>.</B></TT> (dot) delimiters. The
expanded name space permits an aggregate definition for a
variable.
<P>
The lsc script will produce multi-column output. We visualize
the output as a table consisting of rows and columns. A common
definition for row and column is provided by the definition of
a compound variable named <TT>cell</TT>.
<P>
<PRE>
cell=(
  # maximum number of cells
  integer maximum=0
  # maximum width based on entries
  integer width=0
  # current index within the cell
  integer index=0
  # content of the cell
  typeset entries
)
</PRE>
<P>
This defines the variable <TT>cell</TT>, with aggregate
members <TT>maximum</TT>, <TT>width</TT>, <TT>index</TT>, and
<TT>entries</TT>. A reference of <TT>${cell.index}</TT>
provides the value associated with the index aggregate. Using
the <TT>eval</TT> command we can create additional variables
with the same aggregates. We can, for example, define variables
<TT>row</TT> and <TT>col</TT> to have the same definition as
cell:
<P>
<PRE>
eval row="$cell"
eval col="$cell"
</PRE>
<h2>Internationalization Support</h2>
<P>
ksh93 provides support for internationalization.
Double-quoted strings preceded by a <TT>$</TT> are checked for
message substitution. If the string appears in the message
catalog, then ksh93 will substitute the string with the
corresponding string from the message catalog. Otherwise, the
string is unchanged.
<P>
In the lsc example, we display an error message of <TT>"not
found"</TT> for any command line arguments that are not
readable directories. The error message we provide is defined
with internationalization support (see line 33 of <a
href="kornlist.html">Listing 1</a>).
If the shell variable <TT>LANG</TT> is defined to some locale
other than <TT>POSIX</TT>, ksh will attempt to replace the
error message using internationalization support. Otherwise,
the message remains unchanged.
<P>
Executing <TT>ksh -D</TT> on a shell script will output all
messages identified for internationalization. In the lsc
script, for example, <TT>ksh -D</TT> will output the following
message.
<P>
<PRE>
"${video[reverse]} not found ${video[reset]}"
</PRE>
<P>
<h2>Korn Shell Development Kit (KDK)</h2>
<P>
ksh93 is extensible through the Korn Shell Development Kit
(KDK). You can write your own built-in functions in C and load
them into the current shell environment through the <TT>builtin</TT>
command. This feature is available on operating systems with
the ability to load and link code into the current process at
run time.
<P>
A built-in command is executed without creating a separate
process. Instead, the command is invoked as a C function by
ksh. If this function has no side effects in the shell process,
then the behavior of this built-in is identical to that of the
equivalent stand-alone command. The primary difference in this
case is performance: the overhead of process creation is
eliminated. For commands of short duration, the effect can be
dramatic. For example, on SUN OS 4.1 wc on a small file of
about 1000 bytes runs about 50 times faster as a built-in
command than as a separate process.
<P>
In addition, built-in commands that have side effects on the
shell environment can be written. Using the API, available
through the Korn Shell Development Kit, you can extend the
application domain for shell programming. For example, an
X-Windows extension that makes heavy use of the shell variable
namespace was added as a group of built-in commands. The
result is a windowing shell that can be used to write X-Windows
applications.
<P>
While there are definite advantages to adding built-in
commands, there are some disadvantages as well. Since the
built-in command and ksh share the same address space, a coding
error in the built-in program may affect the behavior of ksh,
perhaps causing it to core dump or hang. Debugging is also more
complex since the built-in's code is now a part of a larger entity. The
isolation provided by a separate process guarantees that all
resources used by the command will be freed when the command
completes; this guarantee does not apply to built-ins. 
Also, since the address space of ksh will be larger,
this may increase the time it takes ksh to <TT>fork()</TT> and
<TT>exec()</TT> a non-builtin command [though not on more
advanced operating systems like Linux, which conserve memory
and time by doing ``copy-on-write'' when they fork---ED]. It
makes no sense to add a built-in command that takes a long time
to run or that is run only once, since the performance benefits
will be negligible. Built-ins that have side effects in the
current shell environment have the disadvantage of increasing
the coupling between the built-in and ksh making the overall
system less modular and more monolithic.
<P>
Despite these drawbacks, in many cases extending ksh by adding
built-in commands makes sense and allows reuse of the shell
scripting capability in an application-specific domain.
<P>
In the lsc example, we need to determine the maximum string
size within a list of strings. This is required to determine
the initial number of columns in the multi-column display. We
will also use this to determine the maximum width for a column
of entries. A typical shell implementation would be given as:
<P>
<PRE>
(( max_stringSize = 0 ))
for fileName in *
do
if (( max_stringSize &lt; ${#fileName} ))
then
   (( max_stringSize = ${#fileName} ))
fi
done
</PRE>
<P>
(See <B>Arithmetic Expressions</B>, below, for an
explanation of <TT>((</TT> and <TT>))</TT>.)
<P>
To improve performance, we can re-write this function in C.  In a
simple example, the shell equivalent function required 0.58
seconds of CPU. The C built-in function provided 0.08 seconds
of CPU for the same task. The function name is preceded with ``b_''
to indicate that it is a built-in function. When compiled, the
strlenList.o object is then archived into a shared library. To
reference the <TT>strlenList</TT> function, we must load it into the
current ksh environment through the <TT>builtin</TT> command (see line
29 of <a href="kornlist.html">Listing 1</a>).
<P>
<PRE>
#pragma prototyped
#include "shell.h"
#include "stdio.h"

int b_strlenList(int argc, char **argv,
                 void *extra)
{
    register int max, n = 0
    char **cp = NULL;

    cp=argv;
    while ( *(++cp) ) {
        n = strlen(*cp);
        max = max &lt; n&nbsp;? n&nbsp;: max;
    }
    fprintf(stdout,"%d\n", max);

    return(0);
}
</PRE>
<P>
<a href=korns1.html>Sidebar: Embedded Korn Shell Toolkits</a>
<P>
<h2>Functions:</h2>
<P>
ksh93 provides two methods for function definitions. The
formats are given as:
<P>
<PRE>
function <I>name</I>
{
    <I>body</I>
}
<I>name</I>()
{
    <I>body</I>
}
</PRE>
<P>
The second function format is provided for compatibility
with POSIX standards. The primary distinction is that of
variable name scope. In a POSIX function, a variable definition
has global scope. In the following POSIX function <TT>bar</TT>,
variable <TT>foo</TT> is redefined to a value of 6.
<P>
<PRE>
typeset foo=5
bar()
{
    typeset foo=6
    echo $foo
}
bar
<B>6</B>
echo $foo
<B>6</B>
</PRE>
<P>
Variable definitions in ksh93 functions have local scope. In
the following ksh93 function <TT>bar</TT>, a local variable
<TT>foo</TT> is defined and has precedence over the global
variable <TT>foo</TT>.
<P>
<PRE>
typeset foo=5
function bar
{
    typeset foo=6
    echo $foo
}
bar
<B>6</B>
echo $foo
<B>5</B>
</PRE>
<P>
<h2>Discipline Functions</h2>
<P>
ksh93 provides active variables through a series of
<I>discipline</I>
functions. From the shell level, you can write <I>get</I>, <I>set</I>, and
<I>unset</I> disciplines. Through the Korn Shell Development Kit, you
can also add disciplines unique to your environment.
<P>
When a variable is referenced, as in <TT>$foo</TT>, ksh will
invoke the get discipline associated with <TT>foo</TT>. The
default discipline is to simply return the current value
associated with <TT>foo</TT>. From the shell level, you can
define a <TT>foo.get</TT> discipline function.
<P>
The set discipline is called when a value is assigned to a
variable. Within the set discipline, the special variable <TT>.sh.name</TT>
is the name of the variable whose value is
being set.
<P>
On line 31 of lsc, we define a <TT>max_stringSize.get</TT>
discipline function. Every reference to
<TT>${max_stringSize}</TT> will result in this function being
executed. The value of the special <TT>.sh.value</TT> variable
is the value returned from the discipline.
<P>
<h2><TT>printf</TT> Statement</h2>
<P>
In ksh93, a <TT>printf</TT> statement is available following the ANSI
C <TT>printf</TT> definition. This permits formatting specifications to
be applied to each argument. To appreciate the differences
between the standard <TT>print</TT> and <TT>printf</TT> statements, 
consider how
you would output the contents of the <TT>entries</TT> array (from the
lsc example), one per line. The standard print statement would
display the file names as space-separated tokens on a single
line. Using the <TT>printf</TT> statement with a <TT>"%s<\\>n"</TT>
format, however, would produce the desired results.
<P>
<h2>Arithmetic Commands</h2>
<P>
ksh93 statements of the form <TT>(( <I>expression</I> ))</TT>
are called <I>arithmetic</I> commands. Arithmetic commands
return True when the value of the enclosed expression is
non-zero, and False when the expression evaluates to zero. The
construct <TT>$((<I>expression</I>))</TT> can be used as a word
or part of a word. It is replaced by the value of <I>expression</I>.
<P>
In the lsc example, line 38, we evaluate the value of the
discipline function using:
<P>
<PRE>
(( .sh.value = $(strlenList ${entries[@]}) + 3 ))
</PRE>
<P>
ksh93 will evaluate the expression, which includes an assignment
to the <TT>.sh.value</TT> variable. Note that the:
<P>
<PRE>
$(strlenList ${entries[@]})
</PRE>
<P>
will invoke the <TT>strlenList</TT> built-in function and
return the maximum width of the strings (given as element
values) in the <TT>entries[]</TT> array. We add 3 to this value
for formatting purposes.
<P>
<h2>ANSI C Strings</h2>
<P>
An ANSI C string is defined by preceding the <I>single-quoted</I>
string with a <TT>$</TT>. For example, <TT>$'*'</TT> is the
literal asterisk, <TT>*</TT>. With ANSI C strings, all
characters between the single quotes retain their literal
meaning, except for escape sequences. An escape sequence is
introduced by the escape character <TT>\</TT>.
<P>
ANSI C string support provides an essential feature for shell
programmers. Consider, for example, having to process variables
with embedded tabs in their values. Without ANSI C string support,
we would not be able to
effectively test the value of the variable for embedded tabs.
As an example, consider the following script:
<P>
<PRE>
print "foo\tbar" > /tmp/foobar
read aline &lt;  /tmp/foobar
if [[ "${aline}" == "foo\tbar" ]]
then print TRUE
fi
</PRE>
<P>
The comparison (see <B>Conditional Commands</B>, below) will
fail. We can replace the conditional with ANSI C strings and
ensure proper functionality. The example above should be
rewritten as:
<P>
<PRE>
print "foo\tbar" > /tmp/foobar
read aline &lt; /tmp/foobar
if [[ "${aline}" == $'foo\tbar' ]]
then      print TRUE
fi
</PRE>
<P>
On line 45 of <a href="kornlist.html">Listing 1</a>, we must test to see if the
directory is empty. The preceding <TT>entries=(*)</TT> in an
empty directory will set the entries variable to the literal
asterisk if no files are found.
<P>
<h2>Conditional Commands</h2>
<P>
A conditional command in ksh93 evaluates a test-expression
and returns either True or False. Conditional commands can be
used as part of an ``Or list'' (<TT>||</TT>), ``And list''
(<TT>&&</TT>), or as part of an if-elif-else command.
Conditional commands have the format:
<P>
<PRE>
[[ <I>test-expression</I> ]]
</PRE>
<P>
When used in conjunction with an ``And list'', ksh93
evaluates the test-expression and will execute the ``And
component'' only if the test-expression evaluates to True. We
use a conditional command as part of an ``And list'' such that
the return statement will be executed only if the
test-expression is True.
<P>
<PRE>
[[ ${entries[0]} == $'*' ]] &amp;&amp; return 2
</PRE>
<P>
<h2>Iteration Control</h2>
<P>
The <TT>for</TT> command has two formats. The traditional format is
provided to iterate on each word in a list. The format is:
<P>
<PRE>
for <I>variableName</I> [ in <I>word-list</I> ]
do   <I>compound-list</I>
done
</PRE>
<P>
An arithmetic <TT>for</TT> command has been provided that is very
similar to the C programming language <TT>for</TT> statement. The format
is:
<P>
<PRE>
for (( <I>initExpr</I>&nbsp;; <I>condition</I>&nbsp;; <I>loopExpr</I> ))
do   <I>compound-list</I>
done
</PRE>
<P>
The <TT><I>initExpr</I></TT>ession is evaluated by ksh
prior to executing the <TT>for</TT> command. The
<TT><I>condition</I></TT> is then evaluated prior to each
iteration of <TT><I>compound-list</I></TT>. If the
<TT><I>condition</I></TT> is non-zero, then ksh executes the
<TT><I>compound-list</I></TT>. The <TT><I>loopExpr</I></TT>ession
is evaluated at the end of each iteration.
<P>
<h2>Name Referencing</h2>
<P>
A new typeset option has been added for name referencing.
Using <TT>typeset -n
<I>nameReference</I>=<I>variableName</I></TT> will associate
<TT><I>nameReference</I></TT> with <TT><I>variableName</I></TT>.
A special alias, <TT>nameref</TT>, is provided as the
equivalent for <TT>typeset -n</TT>. A shell script may use the
reference name to refer to the variable name. Name referencing
provides a convenient mechanism to pass the name of compound
variables, or arrays, to ksh functions. This is more efficient
than passing the variable's content.
<P>
In the lsc example, function <TT>setOutput</TT> must add the
directory entries to the appropriate row and column. We could
have defined separate functions named <TT>addToRow</TT> and
<TT>addToColumn</TT> for this purpose. The main body of the
functions, however, would be equivalent. Instead, we opted to
write a single function <TT>addToCell</TT> that uses a
<TT>nameref</TT>
to the cell type passed as a parameter.
<P>
The <TT>addToCell</TT> function accepts three arguments, of
which the first two are required. The first argument is the
cell type and must be either <TT>row</TT> or <TT>col</TT>.
We create a nameref
using the local variable <TT>cell</TT> to be equivalent to the cell type
specified. A reference to <TT>${cell.index}</TT> would
therefore be equivalent to <TT>${row.index}</TT> or
<TT>${col.index}</TT>.
<P>
<h2>FPATH</h2>
<P>
ksh functions are not inherited across invocations of ksh. A
child shell process, for example, does not have access to the
functions defined within the parent ksh invocation. This has
historically limited the re-usability of ksh functions. As a
solution, ksh93 will search the colon-separated list of
directories given by the <TT>FPATH</TT> variable value, for an
executable file with the same name as the function. In the lsc
example, we can eliminate the last statement:
<P>
<PRE>
lsc "${@}"
</PRE>
<P>
The <TT>FPATH</TT> can then be set to the directory
containing the lsc file. From the shell level, we can now call
lsc. ksh93 will load the lsc script and will call the lsc
function with the command line arguments specified. Note that
the supporting functions defined in the lsc script are
available to the lsc function.
<P>
A function autoload feature is provided, in which an
auto-loaded function definition is loaded and retained within
the ksh93 environment upon the first reference to the function
name. This provides better performance since the search and
load steps are eliminated for subsequent references.
<P>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<P>
ksh93, the latest major revision of the Korn Shell language,
provides an alternative to Tcl and Perl. As a programming
language, it has comparable speed and functionality to each of
these languages. Like Tcl, it is extensible and embeddable with
a C language application programming interface. The New
Korn Shell, ksh93, and the Tksh products are available from
Global Technologies, Ltd., Inc., 5 West Ave, Old Bridge, NJ
